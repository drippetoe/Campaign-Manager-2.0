NAME
     OAuthHelper -- Use this tool to experience OAuth in a console.

SYNOPSIS
     OAuthHelper [help | <properties> [<operation> | <url>]]


DESCRIPTION
     This tool lets you: 

     * Request an OAuth token, 
     * Have the user authorize this request token, 
     * Exchange an authorized token for an access token
     * Use the access token to reach protected resources


     The following parameters are used:

     help           Nothing much. See this file instead.

     properties     A simple key/value pair file for parameters. This
     		    file will be both read and written. Initially, it
		    needs to contain the three oauth URLs as well as
     		    your the consumer key + secrets:
      
		    authorizationUrl=https://api-user.netflix.com/oauth/login
		    requestUrl=http://api.netflix.com/oauth/request_token
		    accessUrl=http://api.netflix.com/oauth/access_token

		    consumerKey=...
		    consumerSecret=...


		    After each step, this file will be amended with
		    properties, such as tokens and token secrets. The
		    last access step will also add the user id.

		    NOTE  use 'cmdline.properties.template' as a starting point
		    to set up the property file.

     operation      One of 'request', 'authorize', 'access'. Anything
     		    else will be parsed as a URL and the resource to
     		    be retrieved.

BUGS
     No input validation, little error checking, so you may get
     exceptions if you don't follow the rules above.

     If you see 
     "WARNING: Authentication error: Unable to respond to any of these
     challenges: {}"
     that means the underlying OAuth library couldn't complete the
     request.
