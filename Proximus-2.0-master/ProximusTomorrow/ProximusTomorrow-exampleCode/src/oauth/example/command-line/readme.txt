This is a simple OAuth command line tool that lets you try out
the three flows of OAuth on the command line. 

Before you can use this tool, you need to build the core
OAuth library in ../../core   Please see the readme.txt in that
directory for more info.

Then, build the tool here with  
  $ ant
which builds cmdline.jar

See 'manpage.txt' for info how to use the jar file.
