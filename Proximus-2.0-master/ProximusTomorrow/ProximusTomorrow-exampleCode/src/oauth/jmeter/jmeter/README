Aapche JMeter OAuth

This JAR implements a JMeter sampler called "OAuth Request". 
It's based on HTTP Request with HTTPClient and supports 
OAuth signing. 

To buid, run maven in the jmeter directory,

  cd jmeter
  mvn package

This will build the jar file in jmeter/target directory. OAuth 
library is also included in the jar.

To install the plugin, download the binary distribution of 
JMeter and copy the JAR file to lib/ext directory
under JMeter. This is only tested with JMeter 2.3.4.

Once correctly installed, you should see "OAuth Request"
in sampler menu, right beneath "Mail Reader Sampler".
